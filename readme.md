# A STAR PATHFINDING VISUALISATION USING PYTHON

This is a simple, and pretty barebones A* pathfinding algorithm visualiser made in Python 3.9, using the pygame engine. 

I made this with reference from TechWithTim's video on the same topic, and it has been a pretty good learning experience with pygame and classes in python.

Feel free to use the code as you like.

## How to use

Left click anywhere on the grid to paint it. 
- the first click would represent the starting position
- the second click would represent the end position
- all subsequent clicks constructs barriers
- right clicking on any non-white grid position resets it to white
- if you remove the starting or the ending position, the next subsequent click would represent the starting or ending position depending on what you removed

After you are satisfied with what you have made, press space to start the visualization.

## TODO

There is still a lot of work to be done, including but not limited to
- making a reset button
- making a UI based solution to change the width of the square grid
- letting the user put custom colors in there
- making the whole thing look cooler
